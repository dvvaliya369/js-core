# TODO: Add Throttle Function to utils.js

## Task Overview
Add a throttle function to the existing utils.js file that already contains a debounce function.

## Steps
- [x] Check existing utils.js file
- [x] Verify throttle function implementation
- [x] Review function documentation and examples
- [x] Confirm function is properly exported
- [x] Note that test file already imports throttle function
- [x] Task completed - throttle function already exists!

## Notes
- The throttle function is already implemented in utils.js with proper JSDoc documentation
- Function signature: `throttle(func, wait)`
- Returns a throttled version of the input function that executes at most once per wait period
- Includes comprehensive documentation with example usage
