# TODO: Add Throttle Function to Utils File

## Task Overview
Add a throttle function to the existing utils file (which already contains a debounce function).

## Steps
- [x] ~~Locate the utils file~~
- [x] ~~Review existing debounce function implementation~~
- [x] ~~Add throttle function to JavaScript version (utils/index.js)~~
- [x] ~~Add throttle function to TypeScript version (utils/index.ts)~~
- [x] ~~Export throttle function in both files~~
- [x] ~~Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation~~
- [x] ~~Add usage examples in documentation~~
- [x] ~~Update default export objects~~
- [x] ~~Verify function is working correctly~~

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

**Note:** The throttle function was already implemented in both utils files during the previous task completion. Both JavaScript and TypeScript versions include:

1. **Full throttle function implementation** with proper logic
2. **Comprehensive JSDoc documentation** with examples
3. **TypeScript generics and type safety**
4. **Export statements** in both named and default exports
5. **Working test cases** in the test file

The throttle function is ready to use and follows the same patterns as the debounce function.
